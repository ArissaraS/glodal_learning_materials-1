Presenting time-series and thematic comparisons on Google Earth Engine (GEE) apps allows users to visualize and analyze changes in various geospatial datasets over time. GEE is a powerful cloud-based platform that provides access to a vast repository of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. By leveraging its capabilities, users can create interactive applications to monitor environmental changes, urban development, agricultural trends, and more.

Time-series analysis involves studying data points collected or recorded at different times to identify trends, patterns, and changes over time. Thematic comparisons, on the other hand, focus on analyzing and comparing data based on specific themes or categories, such as land cover types, vegetation indices, or climate variables.

GEE apps enable users to interactively explore these datasets through customizable maps, charts, and graphs. This helps in making informed decisions for research, policy-making, and resource management. The ability to integrate various data sources and apply sophisticated algorithms on the cloud makes GEE a valuable tool for geospatial analysis and visualization.
