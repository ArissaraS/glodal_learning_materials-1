    "An overlay analysis is a process of generating new spatial information for users through processing or analyzing spatial data. For example, if we were to understand the soil distribution for a specific administrative region, we could perform an overlay analysis on the national soil map dataset and the administrative district map dataset and get the desirable result. Overlay analyses can also be used to process various attribute information for datasets.\n",
