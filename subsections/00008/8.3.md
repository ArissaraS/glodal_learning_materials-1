### 8.3.1 Provide hands-on guidance on
#### a. (Basic) [What Is Time-Series Analysis?](https://www.timescale.com/blog/time-series-analysis-what-is-it-how-to-use-it/)

Time-series analysis is a statistical technique used to examine data collected over time, identifying patterns, trends, seasonality, and irregularities. By employing mathematical tools, it helps uncover the structure of the data and provides insights into not only what occurred, but also when and why events happened.

#### b. How to prepare time-series data for analysis

**1. (Optional) Clip image** for region of interest.

**2. (Optional) Resize the images**, if your multiple images are not the same size.

**3. Calibrate the data** 
Apply Radiometric calibration factors to convert digital number to backscatter value: Radiometric calibration is crucial for converting ALOS-2 SAR data into physically meaningful values (like backscatter) that accurately represent the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It ensures that the data is corrected for sensor biases, comparable across different sensors or acquisition times, and suitable for detailed analysis like environmental monitoring, land use classification, and disaster management.

**4. Noise Reduction using a Lee Filter**
The Lee Speckle Filter is a technique used to reduce speckle noise in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery. Speckle noise is a granular noise that naturally occurs in SAR images due to the coherent nature of radar systems, where each pixel contains multiple scatterers contributing to the same radar return signal. This noise degrades the quality of the image and makes interpretation or further analysis difficult. Applying the Lee Speckle Filter on ALOS PALSAR-2 data helps in:
 - Noise Reduction: It reduces speckle noise while preserving important image details such as edges.
 - Improved Interpretation: Cleaned images allow for better visual interpretation and feature extraction.
 - Better Analysis: For quantitative analysis like classification, change detection, or biomass estimation, reduced speckle helps improve the accuracy.

 **5. Layer stacking**
 Layer stacking is used to combine multiple images from different time points or sources into a single multi-band image, which is particularly useful for time-series analysis. By stacking the images into multiple bands, each band represents a snapshot of the same area but at a different time or captured under different conditions. This enables simultaneous analysis of temporal changes in the same spatial location, allowing for better comparison and identification of trends, such as vegetation growth, water body fluctuations, or urban expansion. Stacking ensures that the images are aligned and in a common format, simplifying pixel-based computations like classification, change detection, or statistical analysis across time.
