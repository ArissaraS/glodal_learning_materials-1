# 2. Establishing an end-user applications for public use of scientific data products with their researches

In this session, we will design the material for people who are interested in improving flood models with inputs of snow observations by EO satellites, and establishing an end-user application for public uses. However, they should have practical experiences on satellite data applications, and little experience on end-user applications. Finally, this material suits people who are experts on flood modeling.
Here are the selected contents for the outcomes to achieve the persona's needs.
