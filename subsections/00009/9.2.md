This study investigates the scattering model of oil palm phenology based on spaceborne X-, C-, andL-band polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. The X-, C-, and L-band polarimetric SAR are derived fromspaceborne of TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1A, and ALOS PALSAR 2. Study area is located in oil palm plantations, Asahan District,North Sumatra, Indonesia. 
In this case, the most potential ofthe scattering model of oil palm phenology based onR2is using C-band on VV polarization. However, the scattering modelbased on X-, C-, and L-band is potentially to be used and applied to identify the phenology of oil palm in Indonesia, which isthe main parameter in yield estimation. For the future phenology model needs to improve accuracy by integrating multisensors,including diﬀerent wavelengths on optical and microwave sensors and more in situ data

The Santa Catarina Southern Plateau is located in Southern Brazil and is a region that has gained considerable attention due to the rapid conversion of the typical landscape of natural grasslands and wetlands into agriculture, reforestation, pasture, and more recently, wind farms. This study’s main goal was to characterize the polarimetric attributes of the experimental quad-polarization acquisition mode of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR-2) for mapping seven land cover classes. The polarimetric attributes were evaluated alone and combined with SENTINEL-2A using a supervised classification method based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The results showed that the intensity backscattering alone reached an overall classification accuracy of 37.48% and a Kappa index of 0.26. Interestingly, the addition of polarimetric features increased to 71.35% and 0.66, respectively. 


## (Advance) [A comparative study of ALOS-2 PALSAR and landsat-8 imagery for land cover classification using maximum likelihood classifier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110982317301205)
This study examines ALOS-2 PALSAR L-band dual-polarization (HH and HV) SAR data and Landsat-8 optical imagery for land cover classification. The SAR data has been preprocessed first, which included radiometric calibration, geocoding, and speckle filtering. The HH/HV band ratio has been used to create the third band, and thus a synthetic RGB SAR image was created. The Landsat-8 data was also preprocessed for the classification process. For land cover classification of both SAR and optical datasets, the supervised maximum likelihood classifier was used. Training samples were selected from the Landsat-8 optical imagery with the support of information available in Google Earth; the same pixel locations of training data were used to extract training data from SAR image as well. The Landsat-8 optical imagery was classified and also used for visual assessment of the SAR land cover classification results. Accuracy assessment has been done for both the results of SAR and Landsat-8 data. The SAR classified output gives us accuracy of 93.15% and the Landsat-8 classified map accuracy was 91.34%, while the Kappa coefficient for SAR and Landsat-8 classified images is 0.92 and 0.89, respectively. Classification limitations exist in some cases, such as roads being merged in vegetation areas and some of the barren land is merged in settlements. The land cover classification can be expected to be further improved using polarimetric decomposition methods and fusion of SAR data with optical data.
