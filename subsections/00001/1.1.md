#### Fundamentals of Remote Sensing
##### What is Remote Sensing?
Remote sensing involves obtaining information about objects from a distance, with photography being a common method. Data collection can be ground-based, airborne, or spaceborne, and depends on the information needed, the level of detail, and data frequency. The energy from the sun, known as electromagnetic radiation, is reflected, absorbed, and emitted by Earth's atmosphere and surface. Satellites with sensors measure this radiation to analyze various features of Earth's spheres. The electromagnetic spectrum includes all wave frequencies, though most are undetectable by the human eye. Different materials have unique spectral signatures based on their reflectance and absorption of different wavelengths. For instance, vegetation reflects near-infrared light, making healthy plants appear green, while water absorbs longer wavelengths, making it appear blue. Atmospheric correction helps obtain accurate surface reflectance by removing atmospheric scattering and absorption effects.

##### Satellites and Sensors
##### Satellite Characteristics
- Orbits: Polar/Non-Polar Orbit vs. Geostationary
- Energy Source: Passive vs. Active
- Solar and Terrestrial Spectra: Visible, UV, IR, Microwave
- Measurement Technique: Scanning; Non-Scanning; Imager; Sounders
- Resolution Type and Quality: Spatial, Temporal, Spectral, Radiometric
- Application: Weather, Ocean Color, Land Mapping, Air Quality, Radiation Budget, etc.

##### Satellite Data Processing Levels
Satellite data is available at different stages (or levels) of processing, going from raw data collected from the satellite to polished products that visualize information.
- Level 0 & 1 is the raw instrument data that may be time-referenced. It is the most difficult to use.
- Level 2 is Level 1 data that has been converted into a geophysical quantity through a computer algorithm (known as retrieval). This data is geo-referenced and calibrated.
- Level 3 is Level 2 data that has been mapped on a uniform space-time grid and quality controlled.
- Level 4 is Level 3 data that has been combined with models or other instrument data.

##### Projections and Coordinate Systems
- All spatial data, including satellite imagery, must be indexed, or georeferenced, to a fixed point on Earth’s surface.
- Pairing a data point or pixel with a specific location on the ground requires a coordinate reference system (CRS).
- Two types of coordinate systems are commonly used, geographic and projected.

##### Advantages and Disadvantages of Remote Sensing
##### Advantages
- Provides information where there are no ground-based measurements.
- Provides globally consistent observations.
- Provides continuous monitoring of our planet.
- Earth systems models integrate surface -based and remote sensing observations and provide uniformly gridded, frequent information of water resources data parameters.
- Data are freely available and there are web -based tools for data analysis.
##### Disadvantages
- It is very difficult to obtain high spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolution all at the same time.
- Large amounts of data in a variety of formats can lead to more time and processing.
- Applying satellite data may require additional processing, visualization, and other tools.
- While the data are generally validated with selected surface measurements, regional and local assessment is recommended.
  
##### Remote Sensing Terminology
- Coordinate Reference System: A coordinate-based local, regional, or global system used to locate geographical entities.
- Spatial Resolution: The ground surface area that forms one pixel in the image.
- Georeference: To link spatial data to its correct location.

### Understanding geospatial data and their sources

### (Basic) [Spatial Data](https://pygis.io/docs/c_features.html)
Creating and understanding spatial data is often a vital component in the field of geospatial data analysis. This lesson introduces you to the process of generating new spatial data from scratch, as well as enhancing your understanding of the structure and manipulation of spatial data in Python.

-  [Hands-on with codes for Spatial Data](4*/code/4.1.1spatial_data.ipynb): 

#### [Vector Data](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/vector_data.html)
Vector features can be decomposed into three different geometric primitives: points, polylines and polygons.

- Point

A point is composed of one coordinate pair representing a specific location in a coordinate system. Points are the most basic geometric primitives having no length or area.
- Line String

Lines usually represent features that are linear in nature. For example, maps show rivers, roads, and pipelines as vector lines.
- Polygon

Polygon features are enclosed areas like dams, islands, country boundaries and so on. Like polyline features, polygons are created from a series of vertices that are connected with a continuous line. 

##### Vector Data File Formats
- GeoJSON

GeoJSON is an open standard format specifically designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes, based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It can accommodate diverse types of geographical features such as points, line strings, polygons, and multi-part collections of these types. One of its primary advantages is its readability - both by humans and machines, as it stores all the relevant data in a single text file.
- GeoPackage

GeoPackage is a modern, open standard data format that adopts the principles of open format standards, ensuring non-proprietary access and wide compatibility. It leverages SQLite, a widely used, self-contained, and serverless transactional SQL database engine, making it an exceptionally portable and lightweight choice for data storage.
- Shapefile

A Shapefile is akin to a feature class – it stores a set of features that share a common geometry type (point, line, or polygon), possess the same attributes, and occupy a shared spatial extent.

#### [Raster Data](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/vector_data.html)

Raster data models use a grid of cells, also known as pixels, to represent real-world objects. These data models are often used to represent and manage a variety of entities such as imagery, surface temperatures, digital elevation models, and more.

##### Raster Data File Formats
- GeoTiff

GeoTIFF is a widely-used raster data format in the public domain. It is a great choice when you prioritize portability and platform independence as it embeds spatial information within the TIFF image file itself.


#### [OSM DATA](https://pygis.io/docs/d_access_osm.html)
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global collaborative (crowd-sourced) dataset and project that aims at creating a free editable map of the world containing a lot of information about our environment. It contains data for example about streets, buildings, different services, and landuse.

-  [Hands-on with codes for Accessing OSM Data in Python](code/4.1.1access_osm.ipynb)

#### [CENSUS DATA](https://pygis.io/docs/d_access_census.html)
Census data provides detailed demographic information such as population density, age distribution, and household income. When combined with remote sensing data, it can help in analyzing and visualizing population patterns and trends over geographical areas.
-  [Hands-on with codes for Accessing Census and ACS Data in Python](code/4.1.1access_census.ipynb)

#### Point cloud
Point cloud data in remote sensing refers to a collection of data points in a three-dimensional coordinate system. These points represent the external surface of an object or a geographic area, capturing its shape and spatial attributes.

### Source of geospatial data
There are many sources that you can get geospatial data.
