    "    - In ALOS-2 SAR: Water bodies typically appear dark in both HH and HV polarizations due to the smoothness of water surfaces, which reflect radar signals away from the sensor.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Vegetation\n",
    "    - In ALOS-2 SAR: Vegetation shows up with high HV backscatter due to volume scattering from leaves and branches. Dense forests will be bright in HV and moderately bright in HH.\n",
    "    - In Optical Data: Vegetation appears dark green  in RGB and bright in near-infrared due to strong reflection of NIR radiation by healthy plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forest\n",
    "    - In ALOS-2 SAR: Dense forests are smooth; sparse areas show rougher texture, Dark in both HH and HV because of the multiple scattering from tall tree canopies, trunks, and leaves. Appear bright green in ALOS-2 composite image.\n",
    "    - In Optical Data: Appear dark green in Landsat-5 composite image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bare land\n",
    "    - In ALOS-2 SAR: Bare land appear dark in HV polarizations with moderate to smooth texture. Appear reddish brown in ALOS-2 composite image.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Urban Areas:\n",
    "    - In ALOS-2 SAR: Urban areas show up as bright regions in both HH polarizations due to the strong reflection from man-made structures.\n",
    "    - In Optical Data: Urban areas appear gray or white in RGB composites and are generally dark in near-infrared bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Oil palm Plantation\n",

    "## How to visualize and interpret the results for specific change locations\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize and interpret the results of land cover change from ALOS-2 SAR data in QGIS, you can follow these steps. The goal is to visualize specific change locations (e.g., waterbody, vegetation, bare land, built-up, oil palm plantation) between different periods (2007, 2011, 2015, 2019), and interpret the land cover transitions.\n",

    "### The Temporal/Spectral Profile Tool Tool Plugin \n",
    "\n",
    "The Temporal/Spectral Profile Tool in QGIS is useful for analyzing changes over time in multispectral satellite imagery. It allows you to visualize and interpret how the spectral values (or any raster values) at a specific location change over time. This is particularly helpful when dealing with time series data, such as Landsat or Sentinel imagery, and you want to monitor changes like land cover,  vegetation health, or environmental phenomena.\n",

    "#### Install the Temporal/Spectral Profile Plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open QGIS and navigate to the Plugins menu.\n",
