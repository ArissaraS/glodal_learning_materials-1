# 6.3 Present time-series/thematic comparison on GEE apps

This section provides an overview of time-series comparisons on GEE apps, focusing on their relevance to our study, and presents the time-series comparisons conducted using GEE apps.


## 6.3.1 Present time-series comparisons on GEE apps

Presenting time-series and thematic comparisons on Google Earth Engine (GEE) apps allows users to visualize and analyze changes in various geospatial datasets over time. GEE is a cloud-based platform that provides access to a vast repository of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. 

In this case, NDVI time series tracks changes in mangrove area over time by measuring the greenness of an area around Safwa bay using satellite imagery. NDVI can shows how healthy vegetation is and where the vegetation is. When we look at NDVI data over years, we can see changes in mangrove area, including changes in mangrove forest or planting areas, which can help us understand environmental changes and better manage the natural resources.
