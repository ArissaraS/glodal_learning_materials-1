    "#### Fundamentals of Remote Sensing\n",
    "##### What is Remote Sensing?\n",
    "Remote sensing involves obtaining information about objects from a distance, with photography being a common method. Data collection can be ground-based, airborne, or spaceborne, and depends on the information needed, the level of detail, and data frequency. The energy from the sun, known as electromagnetic radiation, is reflected, absorbed, and emitted by Earth's atmosphere and surface. Satellites with sensors measure this radiation to analyze various features of Earth's spheres. The electromagnetic spectrum includes all wave frequencies, though most are undetectable by the human eye. Different materials have unique spectral signatures based on their reflectance and absorption of different wavelengths. For instance, vegetation reflects near-infrared light, making healthy plants appear green, while water absorbs longer wavelengths, making it appear blue. Atmospheric correction helps obtain accurate surface reflectance by removing atmospheric scattering and absorption effects.\n",

    "- Orbits: Polar/Non-Polar Orbit vs. Geostationary\n",
    "- Energy Source: Passive vs. Active\n",
    "- Solar and Terrestrial Spectra: Visible, UV, IR, Microwave\n",
    "- Measurement Technique: Scanning; Non-Scanning; Imager; Sounders\n",
    "- Resolution Type and Quality: Spatial, Temporal, Spectral, Radiometric\n",
    "- Application: Weather, Ocean Color, Land Mapping, Air Quality, Radiation Budget, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Satellite Data Processing Levels\n",
    "Satellite data is available at different stages (or levels) of processing, going from raw data collected from the satellite to polished products that visualize information.\n",
    "- Level 0 & 1 is the raw instrument data that may be time-referenced. It is the most difficult to use.\n",
    "- Level 2 is Level 1 data that has been converted into a geophysical quantity through a computer algorithm (known as retrieval). This data is geo-referenced and calibrated.\n",
    "- Level 3 is Level 2 data that has been mapped on a uniform space-time grid and quality controlled.\n",
    "- Level 4 is Level 3 data that has been combined with models or other instrument data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Projections and Coordinate Systems\n",
    "- All spatial data, including satellite imagery, must be indexed, or georeferenced, to a fixed point on Earth’s surface.\n",
    "- Pairing a data point or pixel with a specific location on the ground requires a coordinate reference system (CRS).\n",
    "- Two types of coordinate systems are commonly used, geographic and projected.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages and Disadvantages of Remote Sensing\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "- Provides information where there are no ground-based measurements.\n",
    "- Provides globally consistent observations.\n",
    "- Provides continuous monitoring of our planet.\n",
    "- Earth systems models integrate surface -based and remote sensing observations and provide uniformly gridded, frequent information of water resources data parameters.\n",
    "- Data are freely available and there are web -based tools for data analysis.\n",
    "##### Disadvantages\n",
    "- It is very difficult to obtain high spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolution all at the same time.\n",
    "- Large amounts of data in a variety of formats can lead to more time and processing.\n",
    "- Applying satellite data may require additional processing, visualization, and other tools.\n",
    "- While the data are generally validated with selected surface measurements, regional and local assessment is recommended.\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Remote Sensing Terminology\n",
    "- Coordinate Reference System: A coordinate-based local, regional, or global system used to locate geographical entities.\n",
    "- Spatial Resolution: The ground surface area that forms one pixel in the image.\n",
    "- Georeference: To link spatial data to its correct location.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Point\n",
    "\n",
    "A point is composed of one coordinate pair representing a specific location in a coordinate system. Points are the most basic geometric primitives having no length or area.\n",

    "- GeoJSON\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoJSON is an open standard format specifically designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes, based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It can accommodate diverse types of geographical features such as points, line strings, polygons, and multi-part collections of these types. One of its primary advantages is its readability - both by humans and machines, as it stores all the relevant data in a single text file.\n",
