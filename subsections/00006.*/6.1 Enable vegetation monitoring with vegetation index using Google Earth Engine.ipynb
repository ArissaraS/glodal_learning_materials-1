Google Earth Engine allows users to run algorithms on georeferenced imagery and vectors stored on Google's infrastructure. The Google Earth Engine API provides a library of functions which may be applied to data for display and analysis. Earth Engine's public data catalog contains a large amount of publicly available imagery and vector datasets. Private assets can also be created in users' personal folders."

    "\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates the use of Earth Engine to investigate forest vegetation condition over time. Remotely sensed indices such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) are widely used to estimate vegetation status from satellite imagery. EVI and NDVI estimate vegetation chlorophyll content while NDWI estimates vegetation moisture content. All these indices can be derived from free public imagery of satellites like Landsat and MODIS, available in the Earth Engine data catalog. This tutorial uses MODIS EVI data from the MOD13Q1.006 dataset for the period from year 2000 to 2019.\n",
