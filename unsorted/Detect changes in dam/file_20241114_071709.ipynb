Unlike optical sensors, SAR can penetrate clouds and operate day and night, making it ideal for dam monitoring, especially in frequently cloud-covered regions. SAR's sensitivity to surface roughness and moisture content allows for detailed mapping of water extents and surrounding terrain."

In water resource management, ALOS-2 data can be used to monitor dam water levels, assess flood inundation, and map changes in water bodies over time.
