## 8.1.2 (Basic) [Reading and visualizing ALOS-2 data]
### a. (Basic) [Data format (*.tif)](https://www.bluemarblegeo.com/blog/about-geotiff-format/#:~:text=TIF%2C%20or%20TIFF%20stands%20for,image%20data%20in%20geospatial%20workflows.)

TIF, or TIFF stands for Tag Image File Format. Data in this format is pixel-based, and it is often used for high-quality graphics, making it a great fit for image data in geospatial workflows. 

GeoTIFF is a variation of the TIF format that adds a set of tags containing geospatial data in order to provide internal georeference information for the raster data in the file. This means that a single GeoTIFF can be loaded into Global Mapper and will display at the intended and geodetically correct location with no manual rectification needed. 

### b. (Basic) [Python Principles](http://pythonprinciples.com/)
