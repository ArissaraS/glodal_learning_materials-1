## How to prepare time-series observations


### Calibrate the data and Noise Reduction using a Lee Filter

1. Radiometric Calibration (ALOS-2 Data to Sigma-Naught)
Radiometric calibration converts the raw ALOS-2 backscatter values into meaningful physical units (e.g., sigma-naught), which represent the radar backscatter coefficient. This is necessary to standardize the data and make it comparable across different scenes.

2. Speckle Noise Reduction Using a Lee Filter
Radar images, including those from ALOS-2, often contain speckle noise that needs to be reduced for clearer analysis. The Lee Filter is one of the most commonly used filters for speckle noise reduction in SAR images.

### Layer Stacking 

Layer stacking for different years of ALOS-2 data (2007, 2010, 2015, 2020) involves combining multiple individual image layers (e.g., backscatter values from different years) into a single multi-band file. This process is useful for comparing temporal changes in backscatter over the years. With stacked layers, you can study the backscatter trends for specific regions (e.g., oil palm plantations, forests) over time. This enables the identification of increasing or decreasing backscatter values that correlate with changes in vegetation structure.

#### Example of Alos-2 image in HH+HV Polarization in 2007 to 2020
The comparison of ALOS-2 SAR imagery between 2007 and 2020 for detecting oil palm plantations and deforestation can reveal significant changes in land cover. Using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, like that from ALOS-2, helps to detect changes in vegetation structure, deforestation, and land-use conversion.

## How to visualize and interpret the results for specific change locations

To visualize and interpret the results of land cover change from ALOS-2 SAR data in QGIS, you can follow these steps. 
The goal is to visualize specific change locations (e.g., waterbody, vegetation, bare land, built-up, oil palm plantation) between different periods (2007, 2011, 2015, 2019), and interpret the land cover transitions.

### The Temporal/Spectral Profile Tool Tool Plugin 
The Temporal/Spectral Profile Tool in QGIS is useful for analyzing changes over time in multispectral satellite imagery. It allows you to visualize and interpret how the spectral values (or any raster values) at a specific location change over time. This is particularly helpful when dealing with time series data, such as Landsat or Sentinel imagery, and you want to monitor changes like land cover,  vegetation health, or environmental phenomena.


#### Install the Temporal/Spectral Profile Plugin

- Open QGIS and navigate to the Plugins menu.
- Select Manage and Install Plugins.
- Search for “Temporal/Spectral Profile” and install the plugin.

#### Load Time-Series Raster Data

- Load the raster layers representing the time series for the area you want to analyze (e.g., ALOS-2 data for multiple years).
- Make sure each layer represents a different time step (e.g., yearly or monthly data).

#### Activate the Temporal/Spectral Profile Tool

- Once installed, go to the Plugins menu and select Temporal/Spectral Profile.
- This will open the Temporal/Spectral Profile window where you can view the graphs.

#### Select the Time Series Layers:

- In the Temporal/Spectral Profile window, click the "Add" button to load the time series of rasters.
- Choose the layers that correspond to the temporal data (e.g., Value for different dates or years).
- These layers must have temporal information in their metadata or file names, which the tool uses to organize them chronologically.

#### Pick a Location for Analysis

- In the QGIS canvas, use the tool to select a point of interest (POI) where you want to analyze the changes over time.
- You can click directly on the map or manually input the coordinates.

#### View the Temporal Profile

- The Temporal/Spectral Profile tool will generate a graph that shows the change in raster values over time for the selected location.
- The X-axis represents time (e.g., date or year), and the Y-axis shows the raster values (e.g., back scatter value).

#### Interpret the Results

- Increasing Trends: A gradual increase in values over time may indicate positive growth or improvements in vegetation health.
- Decreasing Trends: A downward trend could suggest deforestation, degradation, or loss of vegetation.
- Seasonal Variability: If you're looking at short-term time series (e.g., monthly data), you might observe seasonal patterns in vegetation or land cover.
- Anomalies: Look for sudden peaks or drops in the profile, which might indicate specific events like forest fires, floods, or human interventions.

#### Comparing Multiple Locations and Backscatter Profile


The graph will show how the backscatter for oil palm plantations and forests changes over time from 2007 to 2020. You should expect to see distinct trends, with oil palm backscatter values being stable or increasing as plantations mature, and forest backscatter varying based on deforestation.


#### Oil palm plantation

Oil palm plantations typically show higher backscatter than other agricultural crops due to the structured nature of plantations and tree height.

As oil palm plantations mature, the tree structure becomes more complex, with higher and denser canopies. This leads to an increase in volume scattering, resulting in higher backscatter values. Increasing trends can indicate the expansion of plantations, replanting with younger palms, or improved canopy cover.

#### Forest
Forests show higher backscatter depending on tree density, moisture, and canopy structure.

Deforestation, degradation, or forest fragmentation will cause a reduction in backscatter values. This is due to the loss of canopy cover, leading to less volume scattering and more surface scattering from bare ground or smaller vegetation. Large-scale clearing for agriculture (such as expanding oil palm plantations) will result in noticeable decreases in backscatter for forested areas over time.

- Year 2007: Both oil palm and forest have relatively high backscatter, but forest is likely higher due to denser canopy structure.
- Year 2010: Backscatter for oil palm may rise as plantations mature, while forest could see a slight decline if deforestation is beginning.
- Year 2015: If oil palm expansion is ongoing, backscatter continues to rise, while deforested areas may show a sharp decline in forest backscatter.
- Year 2020: A continued upward trend in oil palm backscatter, indicating mature plantations, and a further decline in forest backscatter if deforestation continues.
