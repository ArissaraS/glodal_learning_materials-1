# 6.1 Enable vegetation monitoring with vegetation index using Google Earth Engine
This section introduces participants to the use of vegetation indices for monitoring vegetation cover using Google Earth Engine (GEE).

## Key Learning Objectives:
- 6.1.1 Introduction to GEE
- 6.1.2 What are vegetation indices and their applications
- 6.1.3 Monitoring vegetation with vegetation indices in GEE

## 6.1.1 Introduction to GEE
### a. (Basic) [Introduction to GEE](https://www.google.com/earth/outreach/learn/introduction-to-google-earth-engine/)
Earth Engine Explorer (EE Explorer) is a lightweight geospatial image data viewer with access to a large set of global and regional datasets available in the Earth Engine Data Catalog. It allows for quick viewing of data with the ability to zoom and pan anywhere on Earth, adjust visualization settings, and layer data to inspect change over time.

 - This tutorial will cover the use of the EE Explorer application, including:
 - how to find data in the Data Catalog
 - adding data to the Workspace
 - explanation of interface features
 - how to tailor data visualization

The goals of this tutorial are to enable you to use EE Explorer, inspire you to discover and view new data, and provide a starting point to imagine how you might expand your exploration using the other more powerful Earth Engine platform tools to answer questions about the current state and ongoing changes affecting the Earth

### b. (Basic) [Get started with GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/getstarted)
This Get Started guide is intended as a quick way to start programming with the Earth Engine JavaScript API. Google Earth Engine allows users to run algorithms on georeferenced imagery and vectors stored on Google's infrastructure. The Google Earth Engine API provides a library of functions which may be applied to data for display and analysis. Earth Engine's public data catalog contains a large amount of publicly available imagery and vector datasets. Private assets can also be created in users' personal folders.

## 6.1.2 What are vegetation indices and their applications
### a. (Basic) [What is a vgetation index ?](https://www.hiphen-plant.com/vegetation-index/)
A Vegetation Index is a single value calculated by transforming the observations from multiple spectral bands. It is used to enhance the presence of green, vegetation features and thus help to distinguish them from the other objects present in the image, depending on the transformation method and the spectral bands used.

### b. (Basic) [What are vegetation indices used for?](https://www.un-spider.org/links-and-resources/data-sources/daotm/daotm-vegetation#:~:text=In%20general%20terms%2C%20vegetation%20indices,of%20the%20plant's%20photosynthetic%20activity.)
Vegetation indices derived from Earth observation satellites are important for a wide range of applications such as vegetation monitoring, drought studies, agricultural activities, climate and hydrologic modeling. Vegetation monitoring plays an important role in drought early warning systems, which help to anticipate the risk of food crises at local and global scale.

## 6.1.3 Monitoring vegetation with vegetation indices in GEE
### a. Composition of Landsat imagery

#### [Landsat 8 Bands and Band Combinations](https://gisgeography.com/landsat-8-bands-combinations/)

**Landsat 8**

The two main sensors for Landsat 8 are the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS).
    - The Operational Land Imager (OLI) produces 9 spectral bands (Band 1 to 9) at 15, 30, and 60-meter resolution.
    - Then, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) consists of 2 thermal bands with a spatial resolution of 100 meters.

Here are the Landsat satellite band designations for the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared (TIRS) sensor. They offer a standardized way to describe the spectral characteristics and capabilities of each sensor on Landsat.

**Landsat-8 OLI & TIRS Sensors**

 - **Band 1:** the Coastal/Aerosol band, has a wavelength range of 0.433 to 0.453 µm and a resolution of 30 meters.
 - **Band 2:** the Visible blue band, has a wavelength range of 0.450 to 0.515 µm and a resolution of 30 meters.
 - **Band 3:** the Visible green band, has a wavelength range of 0.525 to 0.600 µm and a resolution of 30 meters.
 - **Band 4:** the Visible red band, has a wavelength range of 0.630 to 0.680 µm and a resolution of 30 meters.
 - **Band 5:** the Near-infrared band, has a wavelength range of 0.845 to 0.885 µm and a resolution of 30 meters.
 - **Band 6:** the Short wavelength infrared band, has a wavelength range of 1.56 to 1.66 µm and a resolution of 30 meters.
 - **Band 7:** the Short wavelength infrared band, has a wavelength range of 2.10 to 2.30 µm and a resolution of 60 meters.
 - **Band 8:** the Panchromatic band, has a wavelength range of 0.50 to 0.68 µm and a resolution of 15 meters.
 - **Band 9:** the Cirrus band, has a wavelength range of 1.36 to 1.39 µm and a resolution of 30 meters.
 - **Band 10:** the Long wavelength infrared band, has a wavelength range of 10.3 to 11.3 µm µm and a resolution of 100 meters.
 - **Band 11:** the Long wavelength infrared band, has a wavelength range of 11.5 to 12.5 µm µm and a resolution of 100 meters.

**Operational Land Imager (OLI)** generates 9 spectral bands (Band 1 to 9) and is onboard Landsat-8. OLI images can discriminate vegetation types, cultural features, biomass, vigor, etc.

**Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS)** consists of 2 thermal bands with a spatial resolution of 100 meters. TIRS measures Earth’s thermal energy particularly useful for tracking how we use land and water.

**Landsat 8 Band Combinations**

In the case of Landsat-8, some of the popular band combinations include natural color, color infrared, and various vegetation indexes. Each one uniquely displays different features on the Earth’s surface.
- **Natural Color (4, 3, 2):** The natural color composite uses a band combination of red (4), green (3), and blue (2). It replicates close to what our human eyes can see. While healthy vegetation is green, unhealthy flora is brown. Urban features appear white and grey and water is dark blue or black.
- **Color Infrared (5, 4, 3):** This band combination is also called the near-infrared (NIR) composite. It uses near-infrared (5), red (4), and green (3). Because chlorophyll reflects near-infrared light, this band composition is useful for analyzing vegetation. In particular, areas in red have better vegetation health. Dark areas are water and urban areas are white.
- **Short-Wave Infrared (7, 6 4):** The short-wave infrared band combination uses SWIR-2 (7), SWIR-1 (6), and red (4). This composite displays vegetation in shades of green. While darker shades of green indicate denser vegetation, sparse vegetation has lighter shades. Urban areas are blue and soils have various shades of brown.
- **Agriculture (6, 5, 2):** This band combination uses SWIR-1 (6), near-infrared (5), and blue (2). It’s commonly used for crop monitoring because of the use of short-wave and near-infrared. Healthy vegetation appears dark green. But bare earth has a magenta hue.
- **Geology (7, 6, 2):** The geology band combination uses SWIR-2 (7), SWIR-1 (6), and blue (2). This band combination is particularly useful for identifying geological formations, lithology features, and faults.
- **Bathymetric (4, 3, 1):** The bathymetric band combination (4,3,1) uses the red (4), green (3), and coastal bands to peak into water. The coastal band is useful in coastal, bathymetric, and aerosol studies because it reflects blues and violets. This band combination is good for estimating suspended sediment in the water.
- **Panchromatic:** The panchromatic band spans are a longer range of wavelengths and can generate 15m panchromatic images. By pansharpening imagery with the panchromatic band, you can sharpen your imagery producing a crisper product.
- **Vegetation Index:** The vegetation index leverages the properties of the red (which vegetation absorbs) and near-infrared bands (which vegetation strongly reflects). As the name implies, we use it to monitor vegetation health and vigor.
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) always ranges from -1 to +1. Negative values are indicative of water and moisture. But high NDVI values suggest a dense vegetation canopy.
- **Moisture Index:** The moisture index estimates the amount of moisture content. Water appears as blue with lighter shades containing less moisture. Finally, bright orange and red have significantly lower moisture content.

### b. [Monitoring vegetation using vegetation indices in Google Earth Engine](https://chatgpt.com/share/e54c0606-7e47-4c30-92de-4f7d3ec719f7)
Monitoring vegetation using vegetation indices in Google Earth Engine (GEE) involves leveraging satellite imagery to assess and track the health and coverage of vegetation over time. GEE is a powerful cloud-based platform that allows users to analyze large datasets of satellite images. Vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), are mathematical combinations of different spectral bands that highlight vegetation by contrasting it with other land cover types. By applying these indices in GEE, users can generate maps and time series analyses to monitor changes in vegetation health, detect deforestation, manage agricultural practices, and study ecological dynamics. The platform's vast data catalog and computational capabilities make it an invaluable tool for environmental scientists, researchers, and policymakers aiming to understand and manage vegetation dynamics globally.
