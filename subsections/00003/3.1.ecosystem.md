#### (Advanced) [Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation and Mapping through High-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/12/7/914)

This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation and mapping through high-resolution optical satellite imagery (≤5 m spatial resolution). Based on the literature review, 44 peer-reviewed journal articles were published in 15 years (2004–2019). Twenty-one studies were conducted in Asia, eight in North America and Africa, five in South America, and four in Europe. This review article gives a glance at the published methodologies for AGB prediction modeling and validation. The literature review suggested that, along with the integration of other sensors, QuickBird, WorldView-2, and IKONOS satellite images were most widely used for AGB estimations, with higher estimation accuracies. All studies were grouped into six satellite-derived independent variables, including tree crown, image textures, tree shadow fraction, canopy height, vegetation indices, and multiple variables. Using these satellite-derived independent variables, most of the studies used linear regression (41%), while 30% used linear multiple regression and 18% used non-linear (machine learning) regression, while very few (11%) studies used non-linear (multiple and exponential) regression for estimating AGB. In the context of global forest AGB estimations and monitoring, the advantages, strengths, and limitations were discussed to achieve better accuracy and transparency towards the performance-based payment mechanism of the REDD+ program. Apart from technical limitations, we realized that very few studies talked about real-time monitoring of AGB or quantifying AGB change, a dimension that needs exploration.

#### (Basic) [Monitoring and Mapping Vegetation Cover Changes in Arid and Semi-Arid Areas Using Remote Sensing Technology: A Review](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/20/5143)

The document reviews the use of remote sensing satellite sensors and methods for monitoring and mapping vegetation cover changes in arid and semi-arid regions. These regions are environmentally sensitive, with limited water resources and vegetation, making the monitoring of vegetation changes crucial for assessing impacts on land productivity and biodiversity. Vegetation cover change is a key indicator of environmental quality, reflecting hydrological, climatic, and human activity changes.


#### (Basic) [An overview of forest remote sensing technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/overview-forest-remote-sensing-technologies-elias-ayrey-phd-)

Primarily, we have five technologies: Imaging, Photogrammetry, Radar, Hyperspectral, and LiDAR. But before we dive into what those are, there are a few caveats to consider. First, these technologies behave completely differently at different scales. Imagine analyzing a drone image of a tree, where there may be hundreds of pixels representing that tree, versus a satellite image where each pixel is 30 meters wide and there are half a dozen trees inside. Each of those images is very different and gives us vastly different information.   These technologies also vary in terms of cost, availability, and cumbersomness - the best data is expensive and rare, and the densest information may a terabyte of data or more per hectare.

#### (Advanced) [Remote sensing for mapping natural habitats and their conservation status – New opportunities and challenges](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0303243414002451)
This paper provides a synthesis on what is currently feasible in terms of (i) the ability of remote sensing to distinguish vegetation-based habitat categories both between and within several broad physiognomic types: forest, grassland, heathland, and wetland and (ii) the use of remote sensing for assessing the conservation status of habitat types. This review focuses on techniques that aim to map and delineate distinct habitats as the public policy framework generally defines such discrete habitats. Still, deriving proxy indicators that represent structural ecological features and patterns in a continuous manner are used for assessing the conservation status (see ‘Assessing the conservation status of habitats’). The review is based on a systematic literature search within the Web of Science for keywords related to nature conservation (e.g. ‘Natura 2000’) and specific habitat types in combination with remote sensing related terms (such as sensors or classifiers).

#### (Advanced) [Remote Sensing and GIS for Habitat Quality Monitoring: New Approaches and Future Research](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/6/7987)

Our Special Issue presents examples where remote sensing has been successfully used for habitat mapping, quantification of habitat quality parameters, or multi-parameter modelling of habitat quality itself. New frontiers such as bathymetric scanning, grassland vegetation classification and operational use were explored, various new ecological verification methods were introduced and integration with ongoing habitat conservation schemes was demonstrated. These studies show that remote sensing and Geoinformation Science for habitat quality analysis have evolved from isolated experimental studies to an active field of research with a dedicated community. It is expected that these new methods will substantially contribute to biodiversity conservation worldwide.

#### (Basic) [Forest Type Identification with Random Forest Using Sentinel-1A, Sentinel-2A, Multi-Temporal Landsat-8 and DEM Data](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/6/946)

Carbon sink estimation and ecological assessment of forests require accurate forest type mapping. The traditional survey method is time consuming and labor intensive, and the remote sensing method with high-resolution, multi-spectral commercial satellite images has high cost and low availability. In this study, we explore and evaluate the potential of freely-available multi-source imagery to identify forest types with an object-based random forest algorithm. These datasets included Sentinel-2A (S2), Sentinel-1A (S1) in dual polarization, one-arc-second Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation (DEM) and multi-temporal Landsat-8 images (L8). We tested seven different sets of explanatory variables for classifying eight forest types in Wuhan, China. The results indicate that single-sensor (S2) or single-day data (L8) cannot obtain satisfactory results; the overall accuracy was 54.31% and 50.00%, respectively. Compared with the classification using only Sentinel-2 data, the overall accuracy increased by approximately 15.23% and 22.51%, respectively, by adding DEM and multi-temporal Landsat-8 imagery. The highest accuracy (82.78%) was achieved with fused imagery, the terrain and multi-temporal data contributing the most to forest type identification. These encouraging results demonstrate that freely-accessible multi-source remotely-sensed data have tremendous potential in forest type identification, which can effectively support monitoring and management of forest ecological resources at regional or global scales.

#### (Advanced) [A review of methods for monitoring streamflow for sustainable water resource management](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13201-016-0488-y)

   The document reviews various methods for monitoring streamflow to determine optimal water use for sustainable management, especially in the context of climate change. It evaluates these methods based on six criteria: applicability across different terrains and stream sizes, operational ease, time effectiveness, accuracy, environmental impact, and cost. The study concludes that the timed volume method is ideal for small streams in hilly terrain due to its ease of use and accuracy. Weir and flume methods, though more expensive, are recommended for long-term studies of small hill streams because they provide accurate results once installed. For flat terrains, the float method is preferred for smaller streams due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, while particle image velocimetry is suggested for larger streams for its accuracy. The choice of method depends on the stream's volume, the desired accuracy, terrain accessibility, and available resources.
