    "In this session, we will design the material for people who are interested in improving flood models with inputs of snow observations by EO satellites, and establishing an end-user application for public uses. However, they should have practical experiences on satellite data applications, and little experience on end-user applications. Finally, this material suits people who are experts on flood modeling.\n",
