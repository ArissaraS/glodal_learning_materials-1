- Provide hands-on guidance on:
    - How to prepare time-series observations
    - How to visualize and interpret the results for specific change locations



## How to prepare time-series observations


The comparison of ALOS-2 SAR imagery between 2007 and 2020 for detecting oil palm plantations and deforestation can reveal significant changes in land cover. Using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, like that from ALOS-2, helps to detect changes in vegetation structure, deforestation, and land-use conversion.

#### Oil Palm Plantations
A major cause of deforestation, can be distinguished in SAR imagery due to their structured planting patterns.

#### Deforestation
Deforestation results in the removal of dense vegetation, which is converted to agricultural land, such as oil palm plantations.

## How to visualize and interpret the results for specific change locations

To visualize and interpret the results of land cover change from ALOS-2 SAR data in QGIS, you can follow these steps. 
The goal is to visualize specific change locations (e.g., waterbody, vegetation, bare land, built-up, oil palm plantation) between different periods (2007, 2011, 2015, 2019), and interpret the land cover transitions.
