## 10.2.1 Understanding color composite (RGB)

### a. [Colour composites](https://eo.belspo.be/en/colour-composites)

You wil learn the points below from this content:
1. **Understanding Colour Composites:** Learn how digital images, especially from remote sensing, use colour channels (red, green, and blue) to represent different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
2. **False Colour Composites:** Explore how false colour images are created by pairing display colours (RGB) with non-visible spectral bands, such as infrared, to visualize data not detectable by the human eye.
3. **Analytical Use of Colours:** Understand how the human eye's ability to distinguish colours, shapes, and sizes helps in analyzing multi-component data in remote sensing.
4. **Vegetation and Infrared Analysis:** Learn the advantages of false colour infrared composites for analyzing vegetation, where healthy vegetation appears bright red due to its strong near-infrared reflection.
5. **Distinguishing Water and Mineral Surfaces:** Recognize how water and mineral surfaces appear in false colour composites, with water absorbing light and appearing dark, while mineral surfaces vary from blue to white.
6. **Pseudocolour Images:** Understand the difference between colour composites and pseudocolour images, the latter being used to enhance the interpretation of grayscale, monospectral images by assigning colours to grayscale values.

### b. [7 Applications of SAR](https://dragonflyaerospace.com/seven-applications-of-sar/)
This content shows the SAR's ability to provide detailed, real-time data across a wide range of applications making it a critical tool for Earth observation and decision-making in many fields.
1. **All-Weather, Day-Night Operation:** SAR provides continuous Earth observation regardless of weather conditions or lighting, making it invaluable for various monitoring and surveillance tasks.
2. **Versatile Frequency Bands:** SAR operates on multiple frequency bands (X-band, C-band, L-band), each suited for different applications like high-resolution imaging (X-band) and penetration through vegetation or clouds (L-band).
3. **Environmental Monitoring:** SAR plays a key role in tracking deforestation, land cover changes, and the effects of climate change, as well as monitoring glaciers, ice thickness, and polar regions.
4. **Disaster Management:** SAR is crucial for rapid and accurate damage assessment during disasters (earthquakes, floods, landslides), helping coordinate emergency responses and develop mitigation strategies.
5. **Precision Agriculture:** SAR aids farmers by monitoring crop health, estimating yields, and detecting plant diseases, promoting sustainable agriculture and enhancing food security.
6. **Defence and Security:** Its ability to function in all conditions makes SAR essential for surveillance, reconnaissance, and military operations, providing valuable intelligence on ground movements and hidden infrastructure.
7. **Oceanography and Maritime Monitoring:** SAR assists in monitoring ocean currents, sea surface winds, and maritime activities, as well as detecting illegal fishing and supporting marine navigation.
8. **Urban Planning and Infrastructure:** SAR helps in urban development planning by detecting subsidence and monitoring structural health, contributing to the maintenance of critical infrastructure.
9. **InSAR for Deformation Monitoring:** Interferometric SAR (InSAR) enables precise detection of ground subsidence and deformation, essential for monitoring geological processes and the stability of infrastructure like dams and bridges.

### c. [ALOS User Handbook](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/doc/alos_userhb_en.pdf)

This article present the false colour composite where the co-polarisation (HH) band is displayed in the red channel, the cross-polarisation band (HV) in the green and the (HH-HV) difference in the blue channel. With the HH banc sensitive to direct and specular backscatter and the HV band to volume scattering, forest appears green, clear cut areas dark purple, open water black, and flooded vegetation light violet.

Forest change monitoring is a key application of PALSAR, focusing on identifying and tracking human-induced and natural disturbances in global land cover. Regular monitoring is essential, especially in threatened areas like forests and wetlands, as it provides crucial data on where and when changes occur. Multi-temporal SAR color composites are an effective tool for disturbance mapping, offering clear insights into both spatial and temporal changes.

Wetlands monitoring using L-band SAR, like PALSAR and JERS-1, is essential for mapping spatio-temporal inundation patterns, particularly under forest canopies, which optical sensors or shorter wavelength SARs cannot detect. The long wavelength L-band signals can penetrate forest canopies and interact with the ground, enabling the detection of flooding through "double-bounce" reflections between tree trunks and the water surface. Flooded areas reflect a strong signal, appearing bright in SAR imagery, while open water or non-flooded areas show weaker returns, making L-band SAR a powerful tool for detecting forest inundation.

This article present the colour composite in the image represents HH polarisation in red, HV polarisation in green, and HH/HV in blue. In this image, black or dark blue roughly show water or bare land, green shows the vegetation-covered areas, and bright green or purple show the urban areas.

### e. [Combining SAR Bands to Create an RGB Composite]()

To create an RGB composite from SAR data, you need multiple SAR images or polarization channels. The process involves assigning SAR bands (polarizations or temporal acquisitions) to the red, green, and blue channels of an image display. Here is a basic workflow:

Steps for RGB Composite Creation:
Select Bands or Polarizations: Choose three SAR images or polarizations. For instance, you might choose:

Red channel: HV polarization (sensitive to vegetation)
Green channel: HH polarization (sensitive to surface roughness)
Blue channel: VV polarization (sensitive to smooth water surfaces)
Normalize Data: SAR data often has a wide range of values, so it’s essential to normalize each band to a common scale (e.g., 0 to 255 for 8-bit display). This ensures that features in all bands are properly visible when combined.

Assign Bands to RGB Channels:

Assign one band to the red channel (R).
Assign a second band to the green channel (G).
Assign a third band to the blue channel (B).
Visualize the Composite: Display the composite image where different surface features are highlighted based on their interaction with the various polarizations. For example, areas with strong backscatter in the HV channel (e.g., vegetation) might appear green, while smooth surfaces like water bodies with low backscatter in the VV channel may appear blue.

Example:
Red (R): Assign a pre-flood SAR acquisition (HH polarization).
Green (G): Assign a post-flood SAR acquisition (HH polarization).
Blue (B): Assign an HV polarization for post-flood imagery. In this case, flooded areas may show up distinctly in one color due to differences in scattering.
This method allows users to detect and visualize features or changes, making it easier to interpret complex SAR data.
