### c. (Basic) [ALOS Data Application (Examples of Researches)](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/gallery/example.htm)

NASDA's EORC classifies ALOS data application research areas into the following 12 categories;

- PRISM / AVNIR-2: Evaluation of PRISM and AVNIR-2 involves assessing sensor characteristics, image quality, geometric and radiometric calibration and validation, and developing methods for fast and accurate extraction of geo-physical parameters.
- PALSAR: Evaluation of PALSAR focuses on assessing sensor characteristics, image quality, geometric and radiometric calibration and validation, along with enhancing analysis methods using microwave scattering and SAR interference.
- Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Mapping
- Land Use Monitoring and Land Cover Classification
- Disaster Monitoring
- Geological Surveying and Mineral Resource Exploration
- Terrestrial Ecosystem and Forestry Management
- Oceanography and Coastal Zone Related Research
- Snow and Ice Related Research
- Agriculture Management
- Hydrology and Water Resource Management
- Application Research using Geographical Information

## 8.1.2 (Basic) [Reading and visualizing ALOS-2 data]

### a. (Basic) [Python Principles](http://pythonprinciples.com/)

From this tutorials, learners will learn the basics of programming which acquire their knowledge through examples, definitions, and hands-on experimentation. They will improve Python skill with clear explanations and practical exercises. They will get instant feedback on their code, and can test themself with challenges and build skills with projects.

Learners wil learn about the Python Principles from the content below:
1. Introduction
2. Strings and variavles
3. Function calls
4. Function definitions
5. Types
6. Conditionals and comparisons
7. Lists
8. Loops
9. Continue and break
10. Tuples and slicing
11. Dictionaries
12. Objects and methods
13. Final advice

### b. [Reading and Visualizing GeoTiff | Satellite Images with Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/reading-and-visualizing-geotiff-images-with-python-8dcca7a74510)

This hands-on discusses different ways of reading and visualizing these images with python using a jupyter notebook. The libraries used are GDAL, rasterio, georaster, and Matplotlib(for visualization). These libraries will help us in converting those images to simple numpy array format from there we can also perform other image transformations using numpy or TensorFlow.
