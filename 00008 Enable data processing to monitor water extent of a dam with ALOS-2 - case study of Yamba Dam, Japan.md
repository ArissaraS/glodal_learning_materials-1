# Module 8: Enable data processing to monitor water extent of a dam with ALOS-2 - case study of Yamba Dam, Japan

This section is designed for learners who are interested in monitor water extent of a dam with ALOS-2 - case study of Yamba Dam, Japan.

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

1. **Understanding and Handling ALOS-2 Data**:
   - Gain an introduction to ALOS-2 Earth observation satellite data.
   - Learn how to read, process, and visualize ALOS-2 data using Python.

2. **Classify Water and Non-Water area in SAR Data**:
   - Develop skills in classifying water and non-water areas using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data.
   - Learn how to apply threshold-based methods, such as Otsuâ€™s method, for classification in Python.

3. **Detect Changing area Using Time-Series Data**:
   - Acquire hands-on experience in preparing and analyzing time-series satellite observations.
   - Learn how to detect and visualize changes over time at specific locations.
   - Understand how to interpret the results of change detection analyses.

By completing these sections, participants will be able to use Python for various Earth observation data applications, including reading, visualizing, classifying, and detecting changes in satellite imagery.
