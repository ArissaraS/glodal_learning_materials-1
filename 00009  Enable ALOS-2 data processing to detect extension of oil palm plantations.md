# Module 9: Enable ALOS-2 data processing to detect extension of oil palm plantations

**Please add the outcomes of this module**

This section is designed for learners who are interested in detect extension of oil palm plantations, or deforestation with ALOS-2 - case study of Indonesia. With access to ALOS-2 imagery from multiple years (e.g., 2007, 2010, 2015, 2023), long-term trends in deforestation and plantation expansion can be mapped. By comparing backscatter values over time, it becomes possible to see how oil palm plantations have increased, and how forest cover has declined.

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
-  Understand ALOS-2 Data: Gain a comprehensive understanding of ALOS-2 satellite data, including its radar backscatter characteristics and polarization (HH and HV), particularly in relation to different land cover types like oil palm plantations, forests, urban areas, and water bodies.
- Analyze Land Cover Changes: Use ALOS-2 data to identify and analyze land cover changes such as deforestation and the expansion of oil palm plantations, focusing on how backscatter values evolve over time.
