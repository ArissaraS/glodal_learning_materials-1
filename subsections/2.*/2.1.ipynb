    "##### [Redesigning an AI-powered agriculture solution to enhance user interface and cut development costs](https://www.eleken.co/cases/gamaya)\n",
    "Gamaya, a Swiss company specializing in agricultural data processing and analysis, sought to improve its MVP's user interface to attract new customers and enter new markets. Initially, the MVP's UI was complex and confusing, hindering user experience. To address this, a redesign focused on simplifying the UI/UX while minimizing development costs by utilizing React and the Ant Design component library. This approach allowed for rapid implementation of intuitive design components, reducing cognitive load for users. The redesigned platform enabled farmers to access and analyze crop data from open-source satellite imagery and drones, track information through various visualization options, schedule drone missions, and employ scouts for field inspections. Additionally, the platform was adapted for golf course monitoring, allowing for efficient resource deployment, effectively creating two products from one foundational design.\n",
